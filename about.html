      <p>These African stone sculptures are known as Shona sculpture or Zimbabwe Shona sculpture because they are hand carved by the Shona people of Zimbabwe. The Shona people of Zimbabwe have been hand sculpting stone into works of art for nearly a thousand years. <br> Even though the craft is ancient, the style has continually evolved and the carvings created today are both beautiful and elegant.  The contemporary, yet eternal, shape of these sculptures bring splendor to the home and compliments any decor.  The themes these sculptures portray represent  esteemed values in the Shona culture of family, love, life and nature.

  <p>African stone sculpture from Zimbabwe is often called Shona sculpture, named after the largest tribe engaged in sculpting."Zimbabwe"derived from the Shona word “dzimbadzamabwe” which means ‘house of stone’ is the only country on the African continent that has large deposits of stone suitable for sculpting.</p>
    <br>
    In ancient times stone was used extensively for building and for decorative purposes. The Great Zimbabwe settlement, now a World Heritage Site, is testimony to the skill and artistry of the ancestors of today’s sculptors. Built between the 11th and 15th centuries, at a time when Europe was just emerging from the Dark Ages, these accomplished stone masons used hand-hewn granite blocks to painstakingly and precisely build ornate towers and enclosures – all free of mortar. Parts of the settlement combine natural rock formation and dry stone construction – the two blending aesthetically and functionally.
